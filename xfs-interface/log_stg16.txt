=====================
1. Change the if loop for busy wait in resource module to While loooop
2. Add a simple return at the end of Resource module file
3. In the release terminal loop,while changing status of all other processes to 0, start the loop from 0.

Console Interrupt Module
======================
1. When you push variables you used till now,and make sure you dont have all variables in R1,R2... as like
	alias reqPID R1;
	reqPID = 1;
	multipush(R1);
	R1= 9;
	R2 =reqPID;		//This will go wrong

	

========================
INT_6 Code
========================
1. The argument it receives as word address in (UserSP - 3) is logical address and also stack (UserSP -3) is also logical address
	Its like a logical address stored in a logical address	(lmao that doesnt make sense but you get what I mean)
   	
	So you need to convert the stack UserSP - 3 into physical address in INT_6 code and extract the value in it and pass it to MOD_4 ,
	in MOD_4 it receivesthe argument of logical address of word ,so its again translated to physical address and our result is stored there
